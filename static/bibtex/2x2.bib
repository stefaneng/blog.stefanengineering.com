	abstract = {In a parametric statistical model, a function of the data is said to be ancillary if its distribution does not depend on the parameters in the model. The concept of ancillary statistics is one of R. A. Fisher’s fundamental contributions to statistical inference. Fisher motivated the principle of conditioning on ancillary statistics by an argument based on relevant subsets, and by a closely related argument on recovery of information. Conditioning can also be used to reduce the dimension of the data to that of the parameter of interest, and conditioning on ancillary statistics ensures that no information about the parameter is lost in this reduction.},

	abstract = {The 2 x 2 table is used as a vehicle for discussing different approaches to statistical inference. Several of these approaches (both classical and Bayesian) are compared, and difficulties with them are highlighted. More frequent use of one-sided tests is advocated. Given independent samples from two binomial distributions, and taking independent Jeffreys priors, we note that the posterior probability that the proportion of successes in the first population is larger than in the second can be estimated from the standard (uncorrected) chi-square significance level. An exact formula for this probability is derived. However, we argue that usually it will be more appropriate to use dependent priors, and we suggest a particular "standard prior" for the 2 x 2 table. For small numbers of observations this is more conservative than Fisher's exact test, but it is less conservative for larger sample sizes. Several examples are given.},

	abstract = {The problem of testing equality of two independent binomial proportions is reexamined. A recent article by D'Agostino, Chase, and Belanger (1988) argues that the Fisher exact test and the Yates chi-squared test with continuity correction are much too conservative in small samples. The authors proposed using a studentized version of the Pearson chi-squared test, and showed that the empirical size of this test is generally close to the nominal level in repeated product-binomial sampling. Although the article is persuasive on its own terms, two central issues are completely ignored: (a) the propriety of analyzing tests based on discrete data using fixed nominal levels of significance, and (b) the question of whether the empirical size should be computed in repeated samples that fix one or both of the margins. The latter is the key issue; Yates and others (1984) argued that both margins should be held fixed for inference, even though only one margin is fixed by the product-binomial sampling design. The arguments for conditioning on both margins are reviewed and found persuasive; however, it can also be argued that acceptance of the idea of conditioning leads to the likelihood principle, and hence the rejection of significance tests as valid measures of inferential evidence.},

Two-sided tests have also added to the confusion; it is argued that the best definition of a two-sided probability is twice the observed one-tail probability.},

	abstract = {To many, the foundations of statistical inference are cryptic and irrelevant to routine statistical practice. The analysis of 2 x 2 contingency tables, omnipresent in the scientific literature, is a case in point. Fisher's exact test is routinely used even though it has been fraught with controversy for over 70 years. The problem, not widely acknowledged, is that several different p-values can be associated with a single table, making scientific inference inconsistent. The root cause of this controversy lies in the table's origins and the manner in which nuisance parameters are eliminated. However, fundamental statistical principles (e.g., sufficiency, ancillarity, conditionality, and likelihood) can shed light on the controversy and guide our approach in using this test. In this paper, we use these fundamental principles to show how much information is lost when the tables origins are ignored and when various approaches are used to eliminate unknown nuisance parameters. We present novel likelihood contours to aid in the visualization of information loss and show that the information loss is often virtually non-existent. We find that problems arising from the discreteness of the sample space are exacerbated by p-value-based inference. Accordingly, methods that are less sensitive to this discreteness - likelihood ratios, posterior probabilities and mid-p-values - lead to more consistent inferences.},

The approximations are very useful for practical implementation of these exact results. The form of the approximations suggests methods for inference in more general families.},
